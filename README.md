A python program to check whether or not a twitch channel is currently live or not.

To use this you must sign-up to the twitch API, and there you need to register an application.
The twitch api can be found here: https://dev.twitch.tv/


After you register your app, copy your clientID, and your client Secret and paste them to the program.
Then fill in the channel name you want to check, and run it, the function will return True if the channel is currently living, and False if it isn't.
